                <p>Born in 1996, I grew up in the blooming age of technolygy and watched it evolve rapidly into what it is today. I was instantly captivated and decided I wanted to help develope new technologies and encourage others to do the same. Now I go to school for Applied
                    Computer Science, Im learning Japanese, I'm in the process of rebuilding my car, and I like to shoot
                    and edit photos and videos that I take on my adventures. As you can see I picked up a couple of passions but they all point back to technology in some way.</p>
                <p><strong> I created this site to learn</strong> what it takes to build a responsive website but also a medium through which I can share my
                    other hobbies. At the moment this site is strictly HTML and CSS but I'm sure it will evolve as I learn and of course I hope you all enjoy!</p>
